# Overview

It is an open-source, multi-threaded website crawler written in Python. We have so many things to do yet, so feel free to give your contribution here.

Note: It is a part of an open-source search engine. The purpose of this tool is to gather links **only**. The analytics, data harvesting, and search algorithms have been created as separate programs.
